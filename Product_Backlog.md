## Justification for Prioritization

### Must-have Stories
Must-have stories align with stakeholder success metrics for usability and security. These are critical functionalities that ensure the basic operation and security of the system. Without these, the system would fail to meet its primary objectives and user expectations. For example, verifying product authenticity (US-001) and receiving alerts about product expiry (US-002) are essential for maintaining trust and safety in the product supply chain.

### Should-have Stories
Should-have stories add significant value to the system but are not critical for its basic operation. They enhance the user experience and provide additional functionalities that improve overall satisfaction. For instance, providing feedback on product quality (US-004) and accessing educational resources (US-005) help in creating a more engaging and informative user experience.

### Could-have Stories
Could-have stories are not included in this backlog as they are considered nice-to-have features that can be deferred until later phases of the project if time and resources permit.

### Won’t-have Stories
Won’t-have stories are features that have been explicitly excluded from the current project scope. These might be revisited in future iterations or versions based on evolving stakeholder needs and feedback.

By organizing the product backlog using the MoSCoW prioritization method and including effort estimates, we ensure that the most critical functionalities are addressed first, aligning with stakeholder priorities and resource availability.
